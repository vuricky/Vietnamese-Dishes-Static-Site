# Vietnamese-Dishes-Static-Site
A Vietnames Static Website

Purpose: 
A Project that was done at University: Indiana University for the course: I360 - Web Design

About: 
To those that are curious to why I chose to make a site about Vietnamese food, for one,
I am Vietnamese so I felt like it only made sense to create something that I can deeply
relate to, at least on a cultural and personal level. Alongside the bonus of growing up around Vietnamese culture, 
I wanted to spread the cuisine to others around that may have never had the chance to try authentic Vietnamese food, 
or for others who simply would like to learn a dish outside their scope. I believe that spreading culture is one way 
for people to understand one another and creating this website is my contribution to that.
